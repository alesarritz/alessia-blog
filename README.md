# Alessia's blog
Alessia's blog is a project that combines the use of Python, SQL and HTML+CSS. <br>
It is a fully functioning blog, with an admin, users, comment section below every post and a secure password storing method.<br>
The project is part of [The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code) in which I enrolled in 2022.<br>
